      <p class="history">
         The 19th-century mining boom drew many people to Colorado with a hope of striking it rich. Today, 
         travelers can experience a mining train trip 3,000 feet into the Bachelor Syracuse Mine in southwest
         Colorado and see the prosperous, historic main streets of mining towns such as Breckenridge, Leadville 
         and Central City.

      <p class="history">
         Spanish explorers named the river that ran through the area Colorado, meaning 
         "colored red," for its muddy, red hue. It eventually became the name of the territory. Colorado
         is nicknamed the Centennial State because it became a state the same year that the United States
         turned a hundred years old.
