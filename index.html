     <p>The 19th-century mining boom drew many people to Colorado with a hope of striking it rich. Today, travelers can experience a mining train trip 3,000 feet into the Bachelor Syracuse Mine in southwest Colorado and see the prosperous, historic main streets of mining towns such as Breckenridge, Leadville and Central City.
Spanish explorers named the river that ran through the area Colorado, meaning "colored red," for its muddy, red hue. It eventually became the name of the territory. Colorado is nicknamed the Centennial State because it became a state the same year that the United States turned a hundred years old..</p>
